# VulkVox
Voxels in Vulkan

Based heavily on the tutorial from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/

This is most of that code wrapped into a few classes, with a few additional classes to represent a Camera and Vertices, implemented into a loop, to draw voxels (cubes). 

There is ZERO optimization or care taken to implement any of this efficiently, but it could be used as a foundation or example and built upon.

There is basic camera movement support with the mouse (Zoom, pan).
